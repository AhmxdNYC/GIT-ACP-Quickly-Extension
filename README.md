## Usage Warning

- **Special Characters**: The `acp` command supports commit messages without quotation marks for simple texts. For including special characters (e.g., `!#^@&^@$@()&*&(!!!>:<{|}>`), you will still need to encapsulate the message in quotes like this:

- acp " !#^@&^@$@()&\*&(!!!>:<{|}> "

## Requirements

No additional requirements are needed for this extension, as it uses your existing git setup. Just restart or terminate your terminals after installation.

## Extension Settings

This extension does not require specific settings for basic operation but depends on your existing git configuration.

To fully remove the extension, go into the config (zshrc or bash) file and delete the code for the acp function.
